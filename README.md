# Pong OS

A custom ring 0 bare metal OS.

## About

This project was brought into life because I always wanted to be able to say that I had made an operating system. And this would be the perfect oppertunity. The OS will only run my custom implementation of the pong game. Hence that it is called "Pong OS".

## Design Goals

The design of this project is to make a very light weight operating system with a minimal microkernel. And which only has functionalities it needs. Nothing more, nothing less.
